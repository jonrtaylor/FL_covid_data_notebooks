FL_State_level_health_metrics_weekly_data_to_csv.ipynb is a Google Colaboratory notebook which anyone can use to download the weekly update for the entire State of Florida which reports data on positivity rate and other metrics of note which previously was not readily accessable. This data is reported by the State of Florida's Covid Dashboard. From: https://fdoh.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=951e4dbc68a74b92b53dab97006c43f7

FL_cases_by_county_to_csv.ipynb is a Google Colaboratory notebook which anyone can use to download the daily reported Covid cases for each County in Florida as reported by the State of Florida's Covid Dashboard with more detailed demographics than the cases_by_day notebook above. You'd need to keep every day's file and compare across time to develop meaningful analysis, otherwise the file reports the latest data available which is still quite useful.
